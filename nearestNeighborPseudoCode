1. Create a custom hashmap to store packages into
    * remember: The hashmap is just there to make it easier to find stuff as the key will be used to calculate the index of the list
    ** Use this structure to represent the contents of each truck, ie. Each truck will be a hashmap
    *** at the moment, you are only implementing one hashmap to store all its contents.
2. Create a list of all the locations - (Vertex list)
3. Create an adjacency list to store all the distances of a graph
